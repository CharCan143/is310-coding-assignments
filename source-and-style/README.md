# Assignment 1: Inspecting the Cultural Web
## Digital Archive:

## Who buit this website:
The website Internet Archive was founded by Brewster Kahle, however it was built by a team of contributors involved with the Internet Archive. When inspecting the webpage, there is no explicitly mentioned individual creator, author, or developer of the website.
- [Founding and Board of directors](https://archive.org/about/bios)
- [About Internet Archive](https://archive.org/about/)
- [Github](https://github.com/internetarchive)

However, the particular archival collection I have picked was created by Jason Scott, and maintained by a group of [community members](https://archive.org/details/psxgames?tab=about).
